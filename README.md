## Overview

### The challenge

- Have the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Have a good ARIA
- Build an app for portfolio on a small API

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live site URL will be added soon](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, module CSS, CSS Grid;
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Motion library for React

### What I learned

I have learned to use NextJS and SSR, how to make components and keep the project structure clear

### Continued development

An app made for learning purposes and portfolio so I don't think it will be developed further
